# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: 
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
ANSWER
Software engineering involves a comprehensive approach to building software solutions. Software engineering encompasses a broader set of skills and activities beyond coding while traditional programming is specifically about writing code. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-software-engineering-process-and-conventional-engineering-processs/


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
ANSWER
1. Planning and analysis - This allows one to gather the businee requirements from the client and also use feature prioritization to decide what to build and in what order.
2. Define requirements - This phase allow one to clearly outline the requirements that was obtained from the planning phase.
3. Design - This is where architectural and detailed designs are made by defining system components, interfaces and data structures.
4. Development - Implementing features and functionality takes place by writing code based on the design specifications.
5. Testing - This is to vverify software quality and functionality by conducting unit , integration and system testing.
6. Deployment - Deployment of the software to production environments.
7. Maintenance - This is done by addressing bugs, updates, and enhancements thus sustaining the software throughout its life cycle.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
ANSWER
 Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, and small, rapid releases. Agile is preferred in dynamic environments with changing requirements.

Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach. It is more rigid and structured, with each phase completed before the next begins. Waterfall is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and where changes are not expected.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
ANSWER
This is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining software requirements. It is a critical part of the SDLC because it helps ensure that the final software product meets the needs of the users and stakeholders. It involves requirement gathering, analysis, specification, and validation.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
ANSWER
Modularity refers to the breakdown of the software system into smaller independent modules that are cohesive into loosely coupled components that are developed and tested seperatly, and perform specific functions. This approach improves maintainability because individual modules can be modified or replaced without affecting the rest of the system. It also enhances scalability, as additional modules can be integrated as needed to expand functionality.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
ANSWER
Testing is a critical phase in software development that involves verifying that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. The different levels of testing include:
1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or functions. 
2. Integration Testing: Testing combined parts of an application to ensure they work together.
3. System Testing: Testing the complete and integrated software.
4. Acceptance Testing: Testing with the intent of confirming readiness for delivery.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
ANSWER
are tools that help manage changes to source code over time. They allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflict and keep a history of changes. Examples are such as Git, Subversion and Mercurial.

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
ANSWER
Software project manager is involved in planning, executing, and overseeing software projects. Key responsibilities are such as defining project scope, managing timelines and budgets, coordinating team members, and ensuring project objectives are met. Challenges may include dealing with changing requirements, risk management, and ensuring team collaboration.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
ANSWER
oftware maintenance is the process of updating and improving software after its initial release. Types of maintenance activities include: 
1. Corrective: Fixing errors and defects.
2. Adaptive: Updating the software to work in new environments.
3. Perfective: Enhancing features and improving performance.
4. Preventive: Updating documentation and refactoring code to prevent future issues.
5. Maintenance is essential because it ensures the software continues to function correctly and meet user needs over time.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
ANSWER
Some ethical issues a software engineer may face include concerns about privacy, data security, intellectual property, and the impact of software on society. Engineers can adhere to ethical standards by following professional codes of conduct, staying informed about legal regulations, and considering the broader implications of their work.
